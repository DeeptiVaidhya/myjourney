                <p>We are a group of researchers at Northwestern University including psychologists, medical doctors, genetic counselors, and research assistants. Even though we have different training backgrounds, one thing we all have in common is our
                    passion for providing the best care possible for patients with cancer. We combined our expertise to create My Journey, and to make sure that you have accurate and helpful information as you navigate the complex world of genomic tumor
                    testing. We hope that the information and tools in My Journey will help make your experience just a little bit easier.</p>
