                    This study is being conducted to find out about the benefits of a program to improve the well-being of breast cancer survivors. Over the next 8 weeks we will introduce new topics and each module will build on the previous week. 
                </p>

                <p class="content-p">
                    When we discuss breast cancer, we are not only referring to the cancer cells, but also to the entire life experience, including the changes that have occurred as a result of your diagnosis and treatment, the adjustments you may have had to make in your life, and the accommodations you have made to address any side effects you may experience. For instance, as treatment progresses, many women reduce their social outings, find less pleasure in their usual activities, and may lose interest in sex and intimacy.

                <p class="content-p">One concern we have, throughout this program, is preserving the safety for 
                    each of you to speak openly and candidly about your experiences. 
                    Confidentiality is an important condition of the group process. 
                    Some of you may know each other, have friends in common, or go to the same doctor.
                     Many of us may live in the same area or frequent the same places, 
                     and thus we may run into each other outside the group. 
                     It is very important to keep very strict confidentiality about what is said here so 
                     people can speak naturally in the group. When speaking with others outside the group, 
                     you can feel free to talk about what you experienced, what you learned, or what you felt in the group, 
                     but please don't talk about other people's experiences, even without using their name. 
                     And, because we are using web-conferencing, please use the computer in a private room without 
                     loved ones present.</p>

                                        this program and what you hope to gain by participating in it. 
                                        Each of you share a common disease, but probably are different in terms of your 
                                        experience with treatment, medical visits, family support, and other factors 
                                        that help us manage a chronic illness. In this group, we will talk about some of 
                                        these commonalities and differences and try to generate a better understanding of 
                                        what you are going through. </p>
                                    <p class="content-p">In addition, we know that changing unhealthy lifestyle behaviors is 
                                        an extremely important factor in managing a chronic illness. 
                                        Throughout the next seven meetings, we will provide you with some tools that will 
                                        hopefully bolster your physical and mental health.
